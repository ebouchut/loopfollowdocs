## Initial Configuration

After you build LoopFollow the first time, you are presented with a blank screen as shown below.

> ![initial screen for LoopFollow](img/initial-screen-no-credentials.png)


You must provide it with a source of information. One of these two options must be provided or you get a blank screen.

* Nightscout URL with token
* Dexcom Share Account Credentials

The Nightscout URL is required to get the Information Table filled out and for all alerts to be available.

* If only Dexcom Share is provided, the glucose is displayed and some alerts are available.
* When Dexcom Share is provided in addition to the Nightscout URL, then if Nightscout is unavailable, you still have access to glucose readings
