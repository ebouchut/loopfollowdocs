<!--todo-->
<!--Notes: be sure to add this info

-->

While this website is under construction, you can find missing information in three places:

* [Loop and Learn website: LoopFollow page](https://www.loopandlearn.org/loop-follow/)
* [LoopDocs website: Build Other Apps page](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/browser/other-apps/)
* [Trio Docs: Loop Follow Remote Control Configuration page](https://triodocs.org/configuration/settings/features/remote-control/)

## LoopFollow 

LoopFollow is an open-source DIY (do-it-yourself) iPhone app or Mac app that combines display information and alerts for a person with diabetes into a single easy-to-use interface.

LoopFollow was created because using different apps as a parent or caregiver of a T1D can be cumbersome. 
Add in the extra details from looping with an Open Source Automated Insulin Delivery (OS AID) app 
and it can be a challenge flipping back and forth between apps. 
Each app has different strengths and weaknesses. 

* Loop Follow seemlessly displays the information available from a Nightscout URL or Dexcom Share account
* The *Loop* and the *Trio* OS AID systems are actively supported including some remote commanding

An example of the main screen for LoopFollow is shown in the graphic below:

### Community Support and Build Help

Community support for LoopFollow is available on [LoopFollowâ€™s facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/groups/loopfollowlnl). Please use community support for Build problems. It is very unlikely that a new Issue needs to be opened when you are having trouble building. 

Remember, for build help with Browser Build, only your LoopFollow URL is needed. Just exchange your github address for `docs-test` in the example below:

* Example: [https://github.com/docs-test/LoopFollow/actions](https://github.com/docs-test/LoopFollow/actions)

If you do not choose to use Facebook, you can reach out on the [*Trio* discord server](https://discord.gg/FnwFEFUwXE) in one of the build channels.

### LoopFollow Version

The [release history](https://github.com/loopandlearn/LoopFollow/releases) is located in GitHub.

That link provides a reverse chronological list of all code updates.

In addition, at the bottom of the Settings screen for LoopFollow, the version you are using and latest versions are reported. This is an easy way to know if you should updated your app.

### Issues and Feature Requests

Issues and Feature Requests can be provided at [LoopFollow Issues](https://github.com/loopandlearn/LoopFollow/issues). Please review open issues and only open a new one if your problem or feature request is not already described. When reporting an issue, please specify the version of LoopFollow in which you noticed the issue.

## Building Options

This code can be built using [Xcode on a Mac]() or with a [Browser on any computer]().
