<!--Notes: be sure to add this info

While this website is under construction, you can find missing information in three places:

* [Loop and Learn website: *LoopFollow* page](https://www.loopandlearn.org/loop-follow/)
* [LoopDocs website: Build Other Apps page](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/browser/other-apps/)
* [Trio Docs: Loop Follow Remote Control Configuration page](https://triodocs.org/configuration/settings/features/remote-control/)

## *LoopFollow* 

*LoopFollow* is an open-source DIY (do-it-yourself) iPhone app or Mac app that combines display information and alerts for a person with diabetes into a single easy-to-use interface.

*LoopFollow* was created because using different apps as a parent or caregiver of a person with diabetes can be cumbersome. 
Add in the extra details from looping with an Open Source Automated Insulin Delivery (OS AID) app 
and it can be a challenge flipping back and forth between various sources of information. 
Many loopers use *LoopFollow* for themselves because of the flexible (and loud) alarm options.

*LoopFollow*:

* Displays information from a Nightscout URL or Dexcom Share account
* Provides flexible alarm features with a Snooze screen
* Supports *Loop* and *Trio* OS AID systems and provides remote control features
* Supports up to 3 loopers â€“ each with their own unique app name
* Works with your Apple watch
* Runs on an iPhone, iPad or a Mac computer

An example of the main screen for *LoopFollow* is shown in the graphic below:
