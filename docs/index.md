While this website is under construction, you can find missing information in three places:

* [Loop and Learn website: LoopFollow page](https://www.loopandlearn.org/loop-follow/)
* [LoopDocs website: Build Other Apps page](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/browser/other-apps/)
* [Trio Docs: Loop Follow Remote Control Configuration page](https://triodocs.org/configuration/settings/features/remote-control/)

## LoopFollow 

LoopFollow is an open-source DIY (do-it-yourself) iPhone app or Mac app that combines display information and alerts for a person with diabetes into a single easy-to-use interface.

LoopFollow was created because using different apps as a parent or caregiver of a T1D can be cumbersome. 
Add in the extra details from looping with an Open Source Automated Insulin Delivery (OS AID) app 
and it can be a challenge flipping back and forth between apps. 
Each app has different strengths and weaknesses. 

* Loop Follow seemlessly displays the information available from a Nightscout URL or Dexcom Share account
* The *Loop* and the *Trio* OS AID systems are actively supported including some remote commanding

An example of the main screen for LoopFollow is shown in the graphic below:
