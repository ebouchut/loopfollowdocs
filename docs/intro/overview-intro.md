LoopFollow is an open-source DIY (do-it-yourself) iPhone app or Mac app that combines display information and alerts for a person with diabetes into a single easy-to-use interface. It can read data from a Nightscout URL or from a Dexcom Share account and seamlessly switch between them if only one site is operational. LoopFollow supports both the *Loop* app and the *Trio* app and provides remote control for each. 

### Community Support and Build Help

Community support for LoopFollow is available on [LoopFollowâ€™s facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/groups/loopfollowlnl). Please use community support for Build problems. It is very unlikely that a new Issue needs to be opened when you are having trouble building. 

Remember, for build help with Browser Build, only your LoopFollow URL is needed. Just exchange your github address for `docs-test` in the example below:

* Example: [https://github.com/docs-test/LoopFollow/actions](https://github.com/docs-test/LoopFollow/actions)

If you do not choose to use Facebook, you can reach out on the [*Trio* discord server](https://discord.gg/FnwFEFUwXE) in one of the build channels.

### LoopFollow Version

The [release history](https://github.com/loopandlearn/LoopFollow/releases) is located in GitHub.

That link provides a reverse chronological list of all code updates.

In addition, at the bottom of the Settings screen for LoopFollow, the version you are using and latest versions are reported. This is an easy way to know if you should updated your app.

### Issues and Feature Requests

Issues and Feature Requests can be provided at [LoopFollow Issues](https://github.com/loopandlearn/LoopFollow/issues). Please review open issues and only open a new one if your problem or feature request is not already described.
