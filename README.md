Repository for [Loop Follow documentation (under development)](https://loopfollowdocs.org)

## Install

- [**Clone**](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) this project
- Install **Python  3**
  For help getting *Python* installed, see "[Properly Installing Python](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/installation/)".
- Install a **Python Virtual Environment**.  
  In this example, I use [`venv`](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/#how-can-you-work-with-a-python-virtual-environment), but use whichever you prefer.  
  ```shell
  cd loopfollowdocs # where you cloned the loopfollowdocs repository
  
  # Creates a virtual environment using Python 3 in the venv folder
  python3 -m venv venv 

  # Activate the virtual environment
  # IMPORTANT: Run the next line **each time** you start a new shell window/tab
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```
- **Install** the **dependencies** (that is the project's required *Python* packages)
  ```shell
  cd loopfollowdocs # where you cloned the loopfollowdocs repository

  python -m pip install -r dev-requirements.txt
  python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

## Run


### Preview Changes

Once [installed](#install), you can preview the doc locally as you make changes:

- Run the **`mkdocs serve`** command locally in a separate terminal window and keep it running:
  ```shell
  cd loopfollowdocs # where you cloned the loopfollowdocs repository
  source bin/venv/activate # Do this once when opening a shell or if the shell prompt no longer displays `(venv)`
  
  mkdocs serve
  ```
    By default, this runs a local web server that hosts the documentation at http://127.0.0.1:8000/ .
* Preview the site in your Web browser.  
  Most changes will update automatically as you edit.  
  Configuration and navigation changes will require restarting `mkdocs serve`.

### Build the Website Locally

```shell
cd loopfollowdocs # where you cloned the loopfollowdocs repository
source venv/bin/activate # Do this once when opening a shell or if the shell prompt no longer displays `(venv)`

mkdocs build
```

This does not generate the website's PDF version.

### Build the PDF

To export the website as a PDF:

```shell
cd loopfollowdocs # where you cloned the loopfollowdocs repository
source venv/bin/activate # Do this once when opening a shell or if the shell prompt no longer displays `(venv)`

MKDOCS_EXPORTER_PDF=true  mkdocs build
```

 The PDF file is generated in`site/loopfollowdocs.pdf`.

### Find Unused Files

To find unused (orphaned) files in the project:

```shell
CHECK_UNUSED_FILES=true mkdocs build -s
```

> [!NOTE] 
> We use the [`mkdocs-unused-files`](https://github.com/wilhelmer/mkdocs-unused-files) plugin.
 
### Find Broken Links

To list broken links, we use [`mkdocs-htmlproofer-plugin`](https://github.com/manuzhang/mkdocs-htmlproofer-plugin):

```shell
CHECK_BROKEN_LINKS=true mkdocs build --quiet
```

## Contribute

You can contribute to the LoopFollow documentation by correcting typos or suggesting new content.

### Using  the  Terminal

```
cd loopfollowdocs # where you cloned the loopfollowdocs repository

# Activate the Python virtual environment 
#  (if the shell prompt does not display `(venv)`)
source venv/bin/activate

# Declare the official remote loopfollowdocs GitHub repository 
# The remote repository name convention is:
# - origin denotes your copy of the `loopfollowdocs` repository on GitHub
# - upstream denotes the official `loopfollowdocs` repository on GitHub
# You already created `origin` before.
# `upstream` does not exist yet, we now need to create it.
#
# These are shortcuts for the remote repositories 
#   short name => long name (URL)
# We use the short name not to memorize and type the long name (see line below) each time we need to interact with it.
#
git remote add upstream https://github.com/loopandlearn/loopfollowdocs.git

# Fetch the changes from the remote repositories
git fetch origin
git fetch upstream

# Jump on the `dev` branch
# `dev` contains the source code for the site ready to be deployed)
git switch dev

# Bring recent changes for the `dev` branch back from the official loopfollowdocs repository (`upstream`)
git merge upstream/dev

# Example: We want to add a FAQ page in the `docs/resources/` folder

# Create (`-c`) and jump on a new feature branch where to add the FAQ page
#
git switch -c add_FAQ_page

# Create then edit the new FAQ file (`faq.md`)
MY_FAVORITE_EDITOR_HERE docs/resources/faq.md

# Edit, preview, repeat...
# until you are satisfied with the changes.

# ➡️ 🏬: Add the FAQ page to the warehouse
git add docs/resources/faq.md

# 🏬 ➡️ 🚚: Move all the changes from the warehouse into your **local** repository 
git commit -am "Add FAQ page"

# 🚚 ➡️ ⛅️: Push your feature branch `doc/add_FAQ_page` to your remote repository
git push -u origin add_FAQ_page
```

- Now open the **official loopfollowdocs repository** in your **Web browser** 
   https://github.com/loopandlearn/loopfollowdocs/pulls
- Click the **pull-requests tab**  
  This page displays a box saying you can create a Pull-Request for your branch.
- Click the button to do so, then follow the instructions.

### Add a Package

> [!NOTE]
> In this section, the terms Python **package** and **dependency** refer to the same thing.

- **Create** a feature **branch** (aka. topic branch)
  ```shell
  git switch dev
  git switch -c feature/add_dependency_XXX
  ```
- **Add** the pinned version of the new **package** to the **`requirements.in`** file
  ```shell
    MY_FAVORITE_EDITOR_HERE requirements.in
    
    # Add the pinned version of the package to `requirements.in
    XXX_PACKAGE_NAME_HERE==XXX_PACKAGE_VERSION_HERE
    ```
    For example, to add the `mkdocs-exporter` package version `6.1.1`, I added the following line to the `requirements.in` file:
     ```text
     mkdocs-exporter==6.1.1
     ```
- Generate **`requirements.txt`**
  ```shell
    cd loopfollowdocs
    
    # IMPORTANT: The project's virtual environment MUST be activated first
    source venv/bin/activate
    
    # Remove the already installed packages in case you need to start from a blank slate
    # python -m pip freeze --exclude-editable | xargs python -m pip uninstall -y
    
    # Install the development packages
    # (among which `pip-tools` that contains `pip-compile`)
    pip install -r dev-requirements.txt
    
    # Install the direct dependencies (listed in `requirements.in`
    # This also installs the indirect dependencies these packages depend upon.
    pip install -r requirements.in
    
    # Add code/doc using this package and test until it is ready.
    
    # Generate the `requirements.txt` file from `requirements.in`
    pip-compile
    
    # Commit the changes (where XXX denotes the package name)
    git add requirements.in requirements.txt
    git commit -m "➕ Add dependency: XXX"
    
    # Push your feature branch to your `origin` repository
    git push -u origin feature/add_dependency_XXX
    ```

### Add a Chapter

Using the `#` sign shows a chapter on the menu/index. The number of `#`'s determines the level.

**Example**:

```markdown
# README

## Tips & Tricks

### Add a Chapter

### Link to Another File
```

> [!TIP]
> If you want to avoid a chapter ending up in the menu/index, use bold text by:
>
> - either surrounding the text with 2-star signs `**`
> - or adding `<b>` before the text and `</b>` after the text (without spaces).
>
> | Input              | Result        |
> | ------------------ | ------------- |
> | `**bold text**`    | **bold text** |
> | `<b>bold text</b>` | **bold text** |

### Add a Link to Another File

When linking to another Markdown file (ending with `.md`) in another directory, the link must start with `../`.

In the below example, assuming you are editing `docs/install/index.md`, to add a link pointing to `docs/configuration/new-user-setup.md` with the text `new user setup`:

```html
Now on to the [new user setup](../configuration/new-user-setup.md)
```

Do not forget the `.md` suffix.

```
docs                    <== ../ 
├── install             <== ./ denotes the current folder (docs/install/)
│ └── index.md          <== You are here (the current file)
│   
├── configuration       <== ../configuration
│ └── new-user-setup.md <== ../configuration/new-user-setup.md
```

### Update the Glossary


> LoopFollow's glossary is a dictionary for the acronyms and technical terms used in the documentation. It explains them in simple terms.
> It is kind of a personal translator for all the diabetes jargon you will find there.

The glossary is composed of a source file and a generated Markdown page.  
The website uses the Markdown page of the glossary.

**Updating the glossary** is a 3-step **manual process**:
1. Modify the glossary source file ([`includes/glossary.txt`](https://github.com/loopandlearn/loopfollowdocs/tree/dev/includes/glossary.txt) ) to add/update/remove entries.
2. Generate the glossary Markdown page (`docs/faqs/glossary.md`) using this handy shell script:
    ```shell
    ./make-glossary.sh
    ```
    ```mermaid
    ---
    title: Generate the Glossary Page
    ---
    flowchart LR
      subgraph Glossary Source
        text_glossary[/ includes/glossary.txt /]
      end
      subgraph Run Shell Script
        generator{ ./make-glossary.sh }
      end
      subgraph Glossary Page
        markdown_glossary[/ docs/faqs/glossary.md /]
      end

      text_glossary --> generator --> markdown_glossary
     ```
3. **Commit** the changed files (glossary source file and generated page):
     ```shell
     git add includes/glossary.txt docs/faqs/glossary.md
     git commit -m "Update Glossary: ..."
     ```

> [!NOTE]
> Remember to commit these 2 files.

> [!TIP] 
> **Separate the Title and Body with an Empty Line**  
> 
> - Adding a blank line (4 spaces indented) between the title and the body of the text makes a visual distinction for the reader.
>   This is not required. 
> - When present in the body text, empty lines must also use a 4-space indentation.

> [!NOTE] 
> Mkdocs (the site generation engine) does not provide admonitions but [mkdocs-material (the theme) does](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/admonitions) via the `pymdownx` Markdown extension.
